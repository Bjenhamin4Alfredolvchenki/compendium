  "body": "I was born in the land of Oz, and have always dreamed that a hurricane would take me somewhere far. Eventually I actually ended up working abroad, where I began to travel around Asia. I discovered the world of low-cost airlines and began to fly somewhere and see the world every weekend.<br/><br/>Being somewhere in the 15th country, I realized that I had enough experience and knowledge to share with others. Here you will find useful tips, my travel experiences, life hacks and the usual daily thoughts about everything that surrounds me."
